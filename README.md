# covid19pandas
This package presents COVID-19 data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) in pandas dataframes, to make analysis and visualization easier in a Python environment.

We provide this resource because it is important for anyone to be able to easily access data. Nevertheless, you should always follow the COVID-19 safety protocols established by authorities in your area rather than relying on any conclusions you may divine from these data about the state of the world. Established guidelines often include staying home as much as possible, avoiding contact with people outside your household, washing your hands frequently, and wearing a mask in public. 

For some great insights on problems that exist with COVID-19 data, as well as other things to consider when working with these data, read [this article.](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2020/3/ten-considerations-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19)
