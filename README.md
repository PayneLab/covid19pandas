# covid19pandas
This package presents COVID-19 data from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) in pandas dataframes, to make analysis and visualization easier in a Python environment.

We provide this resource because it is important for anyone to be able to easily access data. However, unless you're an epidemiologist, you are **not** qualified to use these data to make decisions about what's a good idea or a bad idea to do as we all try to fight this pandemic.

Regardless of anything you might divine from these data, you should follow official guidelines including staying home as much as possible, avoiding contact with people outside your household, washing your hands frequently, and wearing a mask in public. Thank you.

For some great insights on what problems there are with COVID-19 data, as well as other things to consider when working with these data, read [this article.](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2020/3/ten-considerations-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19)
